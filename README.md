A simple tool to organize your Desktop.

How it works:
1. it creates the folder "Desktop Organizer" on your desktop
  - this folder contains 4 other folders (audios, videos, images and folders)
2. the tool checks all files on your desktop and moves them into one of the four folders
  - it skips the "Desktop Organizer"
  - if a file with the same name exists it will skip it
  - if the file is a link (.lnk or .url) it will skip it
